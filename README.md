# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java that allows two players to play against each other in the console. Players take turns marking cells on a 3Ã—3 board until one wins or the game ends in a draw.  This project demonstrates fundamental Java concepts such as arrays, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling using Scanner.
